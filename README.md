### Built with

- React.js
- Redux
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- This was a very challenging project. It's the first time I implemented the Redux javascript library in order to manage the state for my cart. I became more comfortable with React hooks and can comfortably navigate and implement functions through out my project.
